synopsis:
On Christmas Eve, a magical train known as the Polar Express stops outside a boy's house. The boy, who has been questioning the existence of Santa Claus, hesitates but eventually climbs aboard after being invited by the conductor. Onboard, he meets a spirited girl and a know-it-all boy. The train later stops to pick up a lonely boy named Billy, who initially refuses to board but changes his mind as the train begins to leave. The main boy pulls the emergency brake to let Billy on, despite the conductor's irritation. Billy chooses to sit alone in the observation car. The children are treated to hot chocolate by a troupe of dancing waiters, and the girl saves a cup for Billy. When the conductor and the girl go to deliver it, the main boy notices her ticket is missing and tries to return it. However, the ticket is blown away into the wilderness before eventually making its way back to the train. The conductor discovers the missing ticket and takes the girl with him, leaving the boy worried she will be thrown off. Determined to help, he retrieves the ticket and follows them, climbing onto the train's roof. There, he meets a ghostly hobo who helps him reach the engine. The boy learns the girl has been entrusted to take charge of the train while the engineers repair a headlight. When a herd of caribou blocks the tracks, the boy helps apply the brakes. As the journey continues, the train speeds out of control when a cotter pin from the throttle handle falls off. They narrowly regain control while crossing a frozen lake, returning to the tracks just as the ice cracks beneath them. Back in the observation car, the boy and girl join Billy. The train arrives at the North Pole, where the conductor announces that one child will receive the first gift of Christmas from Santa Claus. While exploring, the boy accidentally uncouples their car, sending it hurtling downhill into a tunnel that leads to Santa's workshop. The children find themselves in a massive gift-sorting facility, where Billy discovers a present with his name on it. Eventually, they end up in Santa's giant sack of presents, joined by the know-it-all boy. The sack is loaded onto Santa's sleigh, and the children are escorted out in time to meet Santa and his reindeer. When a sleigh bell comes loose from the reindeer's harness, the boy initially cannot hear its ring. It is only when he chooses to believe in Santa that the bell's sound becomes clear. He returns the bell to Santa, who chooses him to receive the first gift of Christmas. The boy asks to keep the bell as his gift, and Santa agrees. On the train ride home, the boy realizes the bell has fallen through a hole in his pocket. Saddened, he returns home, where the conductor wishes him a Merry Christmas. The next morning, he finds a small gift under the tree containing the lost bell and a note from Santa. He and his younger sister joyfully ring the bell, though their parents cannot hear it, as they no longer believe. As the boy grows older, he reflects on how his friends and sister eventually stopped hearing the bell's sound as their belief faded. Yet, for him, the bell continues to ring clearly; "as it does for all who truly believe".
