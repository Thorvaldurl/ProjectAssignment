Legend says that, if a teenager wants to get away from peaceful Allburg, USA, he or she must swim the water-filled crypt under the church on Cherry Street. When it becomes Cindy Thompson [Maya McLaughlin] and Lucy Barrett's [Ami Dolenz] turn to try, Lucy loses her necklace in the water. Unfortunately, her necklace is a crucifix, and it awakens a vampire who has lain submerged since the crypt was first flooded 50 years ago. Within 3 days, Lucy, teacher Mark Gardner[Peter DeLuise] and wino Matty [Garrett Morris] are the only humans left to rid the town of the evil.
