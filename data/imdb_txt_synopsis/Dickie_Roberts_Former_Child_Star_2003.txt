synopsis:
If you know the book that states that we learned everything in kindergarten, then you will relate to the theme of this comedy. David Spade plays a former child star of the 70s, Dickie Roberts, who is now 35 and parking cars. Dickie wants to be in show biz again so bad that he will do anything. Dickie auditions for a role as a normal guy in a new Rob Reiner film. Rob says he would give him the part, `but', there is one big problem, Dickie doesn't know what `normal is', because as a child star, he skipped his childhood. Dickie hires a normal family for $20,000 to help him experience for the first time the things in everyday life, that he should have learn while growing up, such as riding a bike, sliding on the water slide, living in a tree house, etc. Douglas Young (the-movie-guy)
