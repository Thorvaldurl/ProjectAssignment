synopsis:
Fred Astaire (Tom) and Jane Powell (Ellen) are asked to perform as a dance team in England at the time of Princess Elizabeth's wedding. As brother and sister, each develops a British love interest, Ellen with Lord John Brindale (Peter Lawford) and Tom with dancer Anne Ashmond (Sarah Churchill--Winston's daughter). Astaire famously dances on the walls and ceiling of his hotel room, and Powell's coloratura voice and comedic touches are featured in several vocals.
