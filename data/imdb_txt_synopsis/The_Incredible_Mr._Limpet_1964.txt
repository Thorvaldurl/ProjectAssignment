synopsis:
Based on the novel by Theodore Pratt, this quaint fantasy leads the viewer from real-life to a spectacular animated deep-sea adventure. Henry Limpet (Don Knotts), a bespectacled, milquetoast bookkeeper, loves his pet fish so much that he longs to be one. When Henry's wish comes true and he's turned into a talking fish, the simple ocean life he'd envisioned proves more exciting than mundane. This is a campy, funfilled movie for all ages. :)
