synopsis:
George and Nina seem like the perfect couple. They share a cozy Brooklyn apartment, a taste for tuna casserole dinners, and a devotion to ballroom dancing. They love each other. There's only one hitch: George is gay. And when Nina announces she's pregnant, things get especially complicated. Vince - Nina's overbearing boyfriend and the baby's father-wants marriage. Nina wants independence. George will do anything for a little unqualified affection, but is he ready to become an unwed surrogate dad? By the end of the movie, the meaning of "extended family" gets a real workout, and some relational clichés get spouted, but the finalé brings things together in relatively agreeable - if unorthodox - fashion.
