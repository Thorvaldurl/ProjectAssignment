synopsis:
It is the summer of 1969. Everyone seems to be waiting for Neil Armstrong to walk on the moon. The Vietnam War is going on, the flower children abound, and there is a big concert at Woodstock. Teenager Alison and her family are on vacation in a holiday camp for Jewish families not far from Woodstock. Pearl, the mother, is young and attractive, but defeated by life. She got pregnant at a young age and gave up on her dreams to devote herself to her children. Marty, the father, is absent because he is busy at the television repair company where he works. Everyone who needs to have their television repaired wants it in time to see the moon landing. One day a charming salesman of clothes and knick-knacks arrives at camp. Pearl falls in love at first sight. He lives an intense life of love and passion, ending with the adventure of going to Woodstock, where Alison and her first boyfriend have also gone. During the concert, the girl sees her mother and runs away. The father goes to the field and, having knowledge of her infidelity, tries to put back the pieces of a floundering marriage. Eventually, the salesman leaves and the parents dance together.
