synopsis:
The various facets of mans innermost feelings, juxtaposed with the romantic arena which was decimated by the brutal power of the Nazis, is the underlining feel of this period drama. An out an out romantic story involving two men and a woman, the story just gives a pointer to how many such dulcet romances was terminated, albeit mercilessly, by the vanity of the people who ran the Third Reich . The story revolves around characters associated with monuments which have stood the test of time, a Jew restaurant named Szabó, and a song which lends the film its title, Gloomy Sunday. Contrary to the musical fiber of the story, the film ends in true whodunit style, a la Citizen Kane.
