synopsis:
Do you know how hard it is to kill a human being? How ugly, messy, long, real and sinful? Do you see a difference between killing for crime and killing for justice? Watch this film. It's an expanded version of Kieslowski's fifth Dekalog - ''Do not kill!'' and it will mercilessly reawaken our dulled by US TV drama and mass media sensibilities concerning what is death, what is murder and what is human
