synopsis:
James Bond, MI6 agent 007 ( Timothy Dalton ) and his friend, CIA agent Felix Leiter ( David Hedison ), are on their way to Leiter's wedding to Della Churchill (Priscilla Barnes) in Key West, Florida when they are collected by Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents to assist them in capturing drug lord Franz Sanchez ( Robert Davi ). Bond and Leiter capture Sanchez by attaching a hook and cord to Sanchez's plane and using a Coast Guard helicopter to pull it out of the air. Afterwards, Bond and Leiter parachute down to the church in time for the ceremony. After the ceremony, Leiter presents Bond with an engraved cigarette lighter with the names of Felix and Della engraved on it as part of a short message, as a way to thank Bond for being Leiter's best man at the ceremony.
DEA agent Ed Killifer (Everett McGill) is driving the van transporting Sanchez across the Seven Mile Bridge, when he suddenly drives the van off the bridge and into the water below, having previously accepted a bribe of $2 million from Sanchez. Some divers arrive at the van on the sea floor and use a mini sub to smuggle Sanchez away. Meanwhile, Sanchez's henchman Dario ( Benicio Del Toro ) and his crew ambush Della and Leiter, killing Della and taking Leiter to a marine research center owned by one of Sanchez's accomplices, Milton Krest (Anthony Zerbe). Sanchez has Leiter lowered into a tank holding a tiger shark. After Bond learns of Sanchez's escape, he returns to Leiter's house, where he finds that Della was raped before her murder and Leiter had his left leg chewed off below the knee. Bond and Leiter's friend Sharkey (Frank McRae) start their own investigation, finding Krest's marine research center. They discover the mini sub used to smuggle Sanchez out of the prison van while it was underwater. That night, Bond returns to the facility, opens a drawer of maggots being used as fish feed and discovers that they are also being used to conceal some cocaine. He is discovered by Killifer, but kills him after pushing him into the same shark tank that Sanchez had lowered Leiter into earlier. The next morning, Bond goes to Hemingway House in Key West to meet M ( Robert Brown ). M orders Bond to an assignment in Istanbul, Turkey. Bond turns down the assignment and then tells M that he wants to resign, but M suspends Bond instead and revokes his licence to kill. Bond becomes a rogue agent and escapes. Later, he returns to the house where Leiter and Della were ambushed and discovers a hidden CD-ROM that contains a file with several names. Most of the informer's names have a status of "deceased" next to them, but one name in the file still has a status of "active" - Pam Bouvier. That night, Bond boards Krest's ship, the Wavekrest, where he meets Sanchez's girlfriend Lupe Lamora (Talisa Soto). Next day, Bond foils Sanchez's latest drug shipment, first by hijacking the mini sub being used to transfer the drugs underwater to the ship from a nearby seaplane and destroying the drug pouches, then by hijacking the seaplane before it takes off with $5 million that Krest paid in exchange for the drugs. He discovers that Sharkey has been killed by Sanchez's henchmen. Bond tracks down and finds Bouvier (Carey Lowell), a pilot and DEA informant at a bar in Bimini. Dario and his men, who knew that Bouvier had been planning to meet Leiter and were waiting to see who came to meet her in his place as a result of his admission to hospital, attack the bar and start a brawl, in which Dario shoots Bouvier in the back, but she and Bond are able to escape in a boat where they spend some time together, during which Bouvier reveals that she only survived Dario's shooting because she was wearing a bullet-proof vest. The boat runs out of fuel after its fuel tank was shot by one of Dario's henchmen during the escape. Bond teams up with Bouvier and pays her $75,000 out of the $5 million that he stole from Krest earlier to accompany her to the Republic of Isthmus. Bond finds a way to replenish the money he paid Bouvier and takes the $5 million to the Banco de Isthmus, where he arranges with Montelongo (Claudio Brook), the bank's manager, to deposit the money into a new account. He then draws some money out to take it to the Casino de Isthmus, where he again meets Lupe and wins big against her, attracting Sanchez's attention. Lupe arranges a meeting with Sanchez in which Bond poses as an assassin for hire. Later, after receiving some unofficial assistance from Q ( Desmond Llewelyn ), Bond plants some plastic explosives concealed in a packet of cigarettes on Sanchez's bulletproof window while Sanchez is meeting with Asian mob bosses to sell drug franchises for $100 million per territory for five years. Bond succeeds in blowing the window open, but two Hong Kong Narcotics Bureau officers, who have some contacts among the mob bosses, apprehend Bond before he can use a rifle to assassinate Sanchez, and take him to an abandoned warehouse. They are joined by Fallon (Christopher Neame), an MI6 agent who was sent by M to apprehend Bond. Sanchez's men rescue Bond and kill the officers, believing they were the ones trying to assassinate Sanchez. Bond plants the idea that someone close to Sanchez has betrayed him. Later, after Bond learns that Krest has brought the Wavekrest to the Republic of Isthmus in order to meet with Sanchez and explain why the payment for the last shipment of drugs went missing, he makes a plan to frame Krest with the help of Bouvier, Q and Lupe, the latter rebelling against Sanchez for physically abusing her. Bond meets Montelongo again at the bank, this time to withdraw the $5 million from his account. That night, Bouvier poses as a sea pilot to navigate the Wavekrest into port, then slams it up to full throttle, causing the ship to crash into the pier. Bond takes advantage of the ensuing confusion to sneak aboard the Wavekrest, where he and Lupe plant the $5 million in a decompression chamber, where it is discovered by Sanchez's henchmen. They bring Krest to the chamber and show him the money. Despite Krest's protests that it is not his money, Sanchez locks him inside the chamber, decompresses the air and then cuts the oxygen supply, causing Krest's head to explode. Sanchez then admits Bond into the inner circle. Worried that Bond might use his admission to pursue Sanchez, Lupe begs Pam and Q to help Bond. The following morning, Sanchez takes Bond to his base, which is disguised as the headquarters of a religious cult, the Olimpatec Meditation Institute. Bond learns that Sanchez's scientists can dissolve cocaine in petrol and then sell it disguised as fuel to Asian drug dealers. The televangelist Joe Butcher (Wayne Newton) serves as middleman, working under Sanchez's business manager Truman-Lodge (Anthony Starke), who uses Butcher's TV broadcasts to communicate with Sanchez's customers in the United States. Meanwhile, Bouvier arrives at the base posing as a rich donor, gains a private audience with Butcher following one of his broadcasts, then holds him at gunpoint. During Sanchez's presentation to potential Asian customers, Dario discovers Bond and betrays him to Sanchez. Bond starts a fire in the laboratory but is captured again and placed on the conveyor belt that drops the brick-cocaine into a giant shredder. As Bond dangles above the shredder, Bouvier arrives and shoots Dario, allowing Bond to kill Dario in the way that Dario had been planning to kill Bond, by pulling him into the shredder. Sanchez flees as the fire that Bond started consumes his base, taking with him four tankers full of the cocaine and petrol mixture. As Bond and Bouvier flee, Bouvier takes back the case of money she had planned to "donate" from Butcher. Bond pursues the tankers by plane, with Bouvier at the controls. During the desert chase, Bond commandeers a tanker, and not long after immobilizing another tanker against a cliff, he makes his tanker lean on an angle with one side of its wheels in the air to avoid a missile fired at it by Sanchez, causing the missile to hit and destroy the immobilized tanker instead. Bond then destroys two more tankers by sending his tanker's trailer down a hillside to crash into the third. Along the way, he kills several of Sanchez's men. One of the cars that they drive falls off a hillside and crashes into Bouvier's plane, forcing her to land near where Bond had abandoned the first tanker's cab. On the final tanker, Bond opens a valve at the back of the tank to release some of the cocaine/petrol mixture before setting it alight to stop some of Sanchez's henchmen. Sanchez attacks Bond with a machete aboard the tanker, but severs several of its hydraulic hoses, which cause the tanker's brakes to fail and send it crashing down a hillside. A petrol-soaked Sanchez attempts to kill Bond with his machete. After Bond asks Sanchez if he wants to know why, he reveals the engraved cigarette lighter given to him by Leiter after his wedding, then uses it to ignite the petrol on Sanchez, setting him on fire. Sanchez stumbles toward the wrecked tanker, causing it to explode and killing him in the process. Bouvier arrives soon afterward in the first tanker's cab to pick up Bond. Later, a party is held at Sanchez's former residence. Bond receives a call from Leiter telling him that M has congratulated him for his work and offers him his job back. He then rejects Lupe's advances, suggesting that the President of Isthmus would be a better match for her, and instead romances Bouvier in the swimming pool.
