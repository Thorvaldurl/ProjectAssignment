synopsis:
Pamela Drury (Rachel Griffiths) is single and works as a serious journalist. She is unsatisfied and looking for a man in her life, but keeps thinking of Robert Dickson (David Roberts), to whom she said no 13 years ago. She then meets an interesting man, Ben (Sandy Winton) and follows him home, only to see him in a family situation through the window. Later she is hit by a car. The woman who drove the car is Pamela Dickson (Rachel Griffiths) - herself in another possible life, married to Robert. She takes her home, and the two of them talk in the kitchen. Suddenly the kids come home and Pamela Dickson disappears, leaving 'our' Pam in a house she has never seen before with three children she does not know! The children assume she is their mother, although they do not quite recognize her sometimes. She soon finds out that her alter ego Pamela Dickson lives in a dull marriage, and writes lightweight articles for a mainstream ladies magazine. She happens to meet Ben again, who in this time-line is a widower. She also manages to wake up Robert's interest and possibly enliven her marriage, but at the end of the movie the two women are switched back to their fomer lives. Pamela Drury is single again, but goes toward a happy end, when she meets Ben again, and finds out he is divorced (and that he seems to have dated the other Pamela for a while!).
