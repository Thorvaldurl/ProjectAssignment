synopsis:
When Erin (Hope Davis) is dumped by her boyfriend (Philip Seymour Hoffman), her mother (Holland Taylor) places embarrassing personal ads on her behalf. Erin reluctantly goes out with a string of men, but a lonely plumber (Alan Gelfant) with aspirations to be a marine biologist keeps crossing her path. If the two could only meet, they might make the perfect pair. Directed by Brad Anderson, the film earned a spot at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival.
