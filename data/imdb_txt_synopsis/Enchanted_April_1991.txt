synopsis:
Lottie Wilkins and Rose Arbuthnot, two married women living in 1920's London share the misery of empty relationships with their spouses and decide to rent an Italian castle for the spring to get away. In order to save money, they advertise for two other women to join them. Mrs. Fisher, an elderly widow who knew many famous authors in her youth is struggling with a lonely and regimented existence and jumps at the chance to join the vacation. Lady Caroline Dester is a gorgeous flapper who has been grabbed one too many times and is sick of men, she only wants to be left alone... or so she thinks... They arrive in San Salvatore' a seaside Italian castle drenched in wisteria and sunshine and find themselves in a romantic landscape that leaves a lot of time to consider their lives in London. After reflecting for a while Lottie decides to send a letter to her husband, inviting him to join her. The next one to join them is Mr. Briggs, the owner of the castle, who is on his way to Rome. He has taken a liking to Rose, believing her to be a war widow. The third guest is the uninvited husband of Rose, Frederick, who has actually come to the castle to see Lady Carolina, whom he has taken a liking to after having met her at a party in London. Rose is unaware of all this and Frederick realizes that he really loves his wife after all.
