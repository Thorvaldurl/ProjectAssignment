Delta of Venus is the sultry adventure of Elena Martin (Audie England), a young female American writer in Paris during the dawn of WWII. All of the stories Elena writes involves her as the star of her own erotic adventures which are secretly contracted by her lover, Lawrence Walters (Costas Mandylor) from a distance. Once this truth is revealed to Elena, her reaction is strong and she transforms from a sexually innocent and unfeeling girl, to a woman who feels everything. She rejects her lover as she leaves Paris to return to America once France is invaded.
