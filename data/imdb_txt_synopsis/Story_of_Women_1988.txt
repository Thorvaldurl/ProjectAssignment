"Une affaire de femmes" known as Story of Women is based upon the true story of Marie-Louise Giraud. During World War II, Marie Latour and her children live poor in a ratty apartment in Nazi-occupied France. Her husband Paul had been drafted to war. Marie discovers her neighbor Ginette is pregnant and wants an abortion. Ginette provides a douche and soap. Using soapy water from the douche, Marie performs a successful abortion on Ginette. Paul returns home. During the war, he suffered injuries rendering him too weak to work. He finds employment but is later fired. After a confrontation between him and Marie, the family moves to a new apartment. Marie meets a prostitute named Lucie and informs her of the abortions. For two years, Marie makes an income performing abortions on women, many of whom had affairs with German soldiers while their husbands were at war. An abortion Marie performed possibly caused the death of a patient. Marie also rents rooms to Lucie and other prostitutes to spend with johns. Using the money, Marie provides better necessities for her family. With a failing marriage, Marie has an affair with a john named Lucien, upsetting Paul.
