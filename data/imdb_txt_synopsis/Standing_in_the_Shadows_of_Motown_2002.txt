synopsis:
The plot is the history of these fantastic musicians and their crucial involvement in the success of the Motown, (and Tamla), record label(s). The stories told, mostly by the principles themselves, are a fascinating look at the City of Detroit when it was very much alive and contained countless music venues, clubs, ballrooms, etc. which are now gone. The film is an extremely moving account made exponentially more so by the deeply felt faithful renditions of some classic hits performed by contemporary young artists during the film. Never was the term 'unsung' more appropriate than it is for the Funk Brothers. One can only hope that they have seen some remuneration from this film, as the record company left them mostly high and dry when it moved to LA, virtually in the middle of the night. At the end of the film we are shown very enthusiastic crowds entering a theater to see the Funk Brothers and the young admirers and adherents perform live. Previously in the film there have been performances by this gathering of highly talented artists but one hasn't really been aware of the audience in the dark back ground.
