synopsis:
Some children grow up believing their parents are perfect. This film asks: what happens when a father is accused of being a notorious Hungarian war criminal 40 plus years after the fact? His lawyer daughter wants to prove he's innocent. In that effort a judge, prosecutor and his lawyer daughter travel to Budapest to meet with a "surprise" prosecution witness who will "nail the coffin" of the accused man. But, they find this witness is a liar. The lawyer daughter, happy believing she's vindicated her father, travels to meet the sister of a military friend of her father's on her way home. While visiting the woman, she asks the lawyer daughter to retrieve and send to her a pawned, old and beautiful Hungarian music box. Once in her hands the lawyer daughter discovers a horrifying truth hidden inside.
