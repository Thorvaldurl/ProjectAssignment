synopsis:
This is a modernizing of the classic Mr. Smith Goes to Washington with the only major exceptions being that it includes a bit of karate and that it bears the undeniable anti-nuke sentiment and even includes much of the original script and original words in full and names of the characters, sometimes borrowing heavily on the original musical score. As with the original, the Hero wishes to build a camp and is wanting to put it in the way of huge power plant being built to fulfill a graft in the home state and in the process is framed for owning the land for the two projects and filibusters to be heard "back home" and pushes for a "national innitiative" to get a vote from everyone on every issue instead of a Congressional and Representative Republic.
