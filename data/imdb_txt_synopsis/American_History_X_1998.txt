synopsis:
Flashbacks, told in reverse chronology and shown in black-and-white throughout the film (opposed to the present-day events represented in color), show Derek's transformation into a vengeful white supremacist in Venice Beach and then his turning away from his bigoted beliefs as well as other experiences while in prison for murder. For the sake of ease, the following plot summary is described in chronological order. Having already been influenced by the latent racism of his bigoted firefighter father (William Russ), Derek is driven to action when his father is shot and killed while fighting a fire in a suspected Compton drug den. A visibly upset Derek is interviewed on television about his father's death and blames the ills of society on people of color, claiming they've systematically gamed the welfare and social aid system and are the source of much of the crime in the country. Derek eventually becomes second-in-command of a Neo-Nazi street gang, the D.O.C. (Disciples of Christ), and entices other young, insecure and angry whites to join. The gang commits acts of violence and intimidation, such as vandalizing a store employing illegal Mexican immigrants which is owned by a Korean. Derek and his crew, most of them wearing ski masks, also attack several employees while yelling racial slurs as Danny films the incident. In another incident, Derek leads the DOC in a basketball game against a group of young black men for ownership of the Venice Beach courts. Derek is fouled during the game when one of the opposing players elbows him in the mouth but refuses to be shaken and leads his team to victory, forcing them off the courts for good as his friends cheer and yell slurs. These incidents go unnoticed by the family until Derek has an argument (involving the Rodney King beating incident from 1991) with his mother's new boyfriend Murray (Elliott Gould), who is Jewish and a history teacher at Derek's high school. Derek becomes enraged when his younger sister, Davina (Jennifer Lien), argues with him and expresses her disgust over what her brother has become. Derek attacks her, grabbing her by the hair and violently shoving some of the meat served at dinner into her mouth. Murray tries to intervene and Derek spits racist language at him, shows him the swastika tattooed on his chest and tells him he's not welcome in their house as a Jew. After his mother talks to Murray outside, she tells Derek to leave their home, which Derek agrees to. Later that night, while Derek is having sex with his equally white supremacist girlfriend Stacey (Fairuza Balk), Danny informs Derek that three Crips members are attempting to steal their father's truck. Derek runs outside and shoots at two of the men with a pistol, killing the first one instantly. He shoots and wounds the second man, the African American basketball player who'd elbowed him in the mouth on the court, and shoots at the car they were riding in as it roars off. Derek marches back to the wounded man to "teach him a lesson" for trying to steal the truck his father gave him. He forces him to put his mouth on the curb, then brutally kills him by stomping on the back of his head. Danny watches in horror as this unfolds. Derek willingly and peacefully surrenders to the police. As he's handcuffed and hauled off, Derek smiles defiantly and stares piercingly at Danny. After being convicted of voluntary manslaughter, Derek is sentenced to three years at the California Institution for Men in Chino. There, thinking that he won't live long while he's incarcerated with other black and Latino inmates, he joins the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang. He's given a job in the laundry and works with Lamont, a young black man. Initially refusing to talk to Lamont, Derek eventually becomes friendly with him. When Derek asks him why he's been jailed, Lamont says he was arrested while stealing a television and was given six years. Derek is incredulous, believing the sentence was too harsh until Lamont explains that the TV fell on the foot of one of the arresting officers and assault was added to his charges. After about a year, Derek becomes disillusioned with the gang, especially over the group's friendly dealings with a Mexican prison gang member, and their trafficking in narcotics. When he voices these opinions, he is first ignored and then reprimanded by the other white supremacists. Derek's friendly rapport with Lamont and his refusal to sit with the Aryans during meals draw their attention and they savagely beat and rape him in the shower. While still recovering from the attack, Derek is visited by Dr. Bob Sweeney (Avery Brooks), whom he asks for help to be paroled. Although Derek had become a violent racist and anti-Semite, he had always maintained a level of respect for his African American teacher. Sweeney informs him of Danny's aspirations to become a Neo-Nazi like Derek. Sweeney confides in Derek that he used to hate white people as a youth, but he came to realize that racism and hatred are pointless. Sweeney asserts that Derek has spent his life pursuing answers, and then asks: "Has anything you've done made your life better?" This proves a turning point for Derek, who further distances himself from the Aryan Brotherhood and changes his outlook on life. Lamont emerges as Derek's only true friend in prison and is part of the reason Derek stays alive as he uses what influence he has to persuade a contingent of the other African American prisoners not to attack Derek. The morning Derek is due to be released from prison, Danny's history teacher, Murray, reports Danny to the now-principal Dr. Sweeney for a paper he wrote on Adolf Hitler's autobiography, Mein Kampf, where Danny claims Adolf Hitler was a champion of civil rights. Murray is personally offended and asks for a harsh punishment for Danny but Dr. Sweeney convinces Murray to give him another chance, arguing that he won't give up on Danny. Dr. Sweeney tells Danny that he will no longer attend Murray's class, instead being taught history by himself, a class they will call "American History X". For their first lesson, Dr. Sweeney asks Danny to write a new paper on the events leading up to Derek's incarceration that he will turn in the next morning. Danny reluctantly agrees after Sweeney threatens him with expulsion. Later that day when Danny returns home from school, Derek discovers that his brother has unfortunately followed Derek's path and become a white power skinhead. Derek is also quite upset to see that Danny has a white supremacist's tattoo on his arm given to him by Derek's former captain, Cameron Alexander (Stacy Keach), the leader of the local chapter of Neo-Nazi youth. While Derek talks to Sweeney on the phone about Danny's Mein Kampf assignment, one of Derek's old friends, Seth (Ethan Suplee) arrives and films Danny spouting about white supremacy. Davina is highly offended, prompting Seth to throw sexist and racist insults at her. Derek eventually gets Seth to leave him alone with his family and Derek proposes they move out of the ramshackle apartment they now live in for a better life. Seth mentions that Cameron is having a party at his place. Derek tells Danny privately to promise he won't go to the party and Danny reluctantly agrees. Danny is picked up at home for the party by two of his friends while considering including in his paper a confessionary statement saying if he'd been called to the witness stand at his brother's trial, Derek would've gotten a life sentence. At the party thrown by Cameron, Derek confronts his former leader and tells him that he will no longer associate with him and the gang and tells him to keep away from himself and Danny. Derek realizes that Cameron has been eyeing Danny as a protégé and a replacement for Derek. Derek also reveals that he knows that while Cameron was serving prison time himself, he had his sentence reduced when he rolled over on two of his teenaged soldiers. An infuriated Cameron provokes Derek, saying that Danny will willingly come back. Derek is instantly enraged, hits Cameron and kicks him, leaving him dazed before retreating outside. During an ensuing confrontation, Seth runs after Derek and aims a pistol at him, which Derek wrestles from him, and points at the angry crowd before running away from the party. Danny angrily confronts Derek, who tells him about his time and transformation in prison. The confession seems to prompt a change in Danny. The following morning Danny finishes his paper, and Derek gets ready for a meeting with his parole officer. Derek walks Danny to school before his meeting, and on their way, they stop at a café where they are met by Dr. Sweeney and a police officer. They tell Derek that Cameron and Seth were attacked the previous night and have been hospitalized. Derek claims no knowledge of the incidents, yet they ask him for help, believing Derek can convince other DOC members not to commit any retaliatory acts over Cameron and Seth's attacks. Derek reluctantly agrees, knowing it could be dangerous for him. At school, after Danny uses the urinal in the bathroom, he is confronted by Little Henry, the young African American student with whom he had a confrontation the previous day. He uses a handgun and shoots and kills Danny, sending him flying, blood spattering against the urinal and dropping his written report. When Derek arrives, he runs into the bathroom and tearfully cradles his dead brother in his arms. The film ends with Danny narrating part of his paper, in which he quotes the conclusion of Abraham Lincoln's first inaugural address: "We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory will swell when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature."
