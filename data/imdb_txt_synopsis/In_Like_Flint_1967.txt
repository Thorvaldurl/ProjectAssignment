synopsis:
You have to watch this with tongue firmly in cheek. I feel the Flint movies are the best satire of the James Bond superspy motif. This is the second movie but obviously can enjoy it without having seen first. Patently ridiculous plot about secret organization taking over the world, but who is it and why?? Women have joined together and using beauty spas have been serrupticiously hypnotizing women around the world. I think one of the funniest jokes is one I missed first time I watched it: the names of the three male scientist who joined with women to conquer the world...small joke but type of thing this movie has in it all over the place that a lot of time is I think is missed because so much of rest of movie is "over the top," as you might say.
