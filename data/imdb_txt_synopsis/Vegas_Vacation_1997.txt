synopsis:
Following the approval of the food preservative he helped create that keeps perishable goods fresh for years, Clark Griswold receives the bonus that Frank Shirley promised him in the last movie. He tells his family that he and his wife Ellen are going on vacation to celebrate and reaffirm their vows. Clark's announcement that they are going to Las Vegas, however, dampens the excitement. Las Vegas is not known for being a family-friendly place, so Ellen and her teenage daughter Audrey are hesitant, but their teenage son Rusty seems more excited. When the Griswolds first arrive in Vegas, they visit Cousin Eddie, the husband of Ellen's cousin Catherine, and go to a Siegfried & Roy show. Eddie now resides with his family on a former hydrogen bomb test site in the desert north of Las Vegas. Clark is separated from the group during a guided tour of the Hoover Dam by Arty after he unintentionally causes a leak in the interior walkways and must scale the scaffolding to the top of the dam in order to escape. The following evening, they discover to their surprise that a dress for Ellen and tickets to a Wayne Newton concert have been delivered to their hotel room. They discover that Newton sent the dress when they arrive at the concert. As he sings, he visits their table and invites Ellen to join him on stage. The following day, the family consents to a "alone day" and is left on their own. Following his visit to a casino, Clark develops a gambling addiction. Rusty becomes a successful high roller after purchasing a phony ID from a Frank Sinatra impersonator. Vicki, Eddie's free-spirited exotic dancer daughter, and her friends begin to hang out with Audrey. Wayne Newton, who is attracted to Ellen, spends time with her. When Clark gambles away the family's $22,600 bank account, Ellen becomes enraged and the children leave him. Audrey and Vicki visit a strip club and Audrey secures a job as a go-go dancer, while Rusty wins four cars from four different slot machines. Since the Griswolds have helped Clark and his family so much, Eddie, who has money buried in his front yard, tries to help him. When Clark and Eddie visit a casino to retrieve their money, Clark also gambles away Eddie's money. Afterwards, he understands that he must get his family back and no longer cares about getting his money back. Clark brings his family together from the Vegas area, and they play keno to spend their final two dollars. They are seated next to an elderly man who tells Clark how happy he is with his family and suggests that he has always been lonely. In a show of compassion, Clark advises the man to spend the night with the Griswold family. The game starts after the man gladly accepts Clark's offer. Initially hopeful, the Griswolds sit in silence as they come to terms with their defeat. The man next to them abruptly announces that he has won the game. While Ellen sends Rusty for assistance, he drifts in and out of consciousness in his emotional outburst. He survives long enough to speak to Clark in a whisper. According to Clark, who is perplexed, the man said, "Take the ticket." The man is declared dead by the paramedics and casino security officers upon their arrival. Mr. Ellis was his name, and they tell the Griswolds that he would have done anything for a friend. In front of Eddie's relatives, Clark and Ellen exchange vows of marriage after winning a lot of money. In return for his generosity, Clark then gives Eddie $5,000. Rusty won four cars from the slot machines: a white Ford Aspire, a black Hummer H1, a maroon Ford Mustang, and a red Dodge Viper. The Griswolds drive home in these vehicles.
