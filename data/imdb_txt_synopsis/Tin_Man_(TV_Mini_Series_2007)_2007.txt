synopsis:
Tin Man is a bold re-imagining of the Frank L. Baum classic, The Wizard of Oz. This miniseries is set in an Oz that is part fantasy, part sci-fi, where good and evil balance on a razor's edge in a terrible 15-year struggle for domination. Thrust into this decidedly darker Oz-- or Outer Zone-- is young DG ( Zooey Deschanel ), a waitress at a roadside diner who feels that she doesn't fit into the life she's living, and dreams of something bigger and better. Little does DG know that she is about to find herself in a world that is indeed bigger, and more wondrous, but is also frightening and terrible. Aided by the addled Glitch ( Alan Cumming ), the psychic leonine Viewer Raw ( Raoul Max Trujillo ), and the hard-as-nails ex-police officer Wyatt Cain ( Neal McDonough ), known as a 'Tin Man' in the O.Z. DG must brave this strange world and face up to the most unlikely of enemies as she learns stunning truths not only about the O.Z. ... but about her own past and future. As a miniseries on the SyFy cable channel, Tin Man aired in three episodes. Each episode is being given its own synopsis. Please visit the episode links and see each episode for its synopsis.
