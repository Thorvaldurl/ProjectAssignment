synopsis:
A middle-aged man, perhaps having a mid-life crisis or suffering from writers block, returns to the city of his birth, Medellin, Colombia, to occupy the vacant apartment he has inherited from his dead sister. He is appalled by the violence and the well-armed adolescent thugs who rule the streets, but quite attracted to teen-age male prostitutes, some of whom, amazingly, fulfill both roles. Roaming the city, the writer discovers the old homosexual dream of true love with the fabled boy prostitute with a heart of gold -- and who is also an assassin. This unlikely scenario takes place not once, but twice, and predictably ends tragically. The musical theme is the very appropriate classic, Senderito de Amor (Path of Love) which begins, one love abandoned me, another forgot me; I roam the world in pain.
