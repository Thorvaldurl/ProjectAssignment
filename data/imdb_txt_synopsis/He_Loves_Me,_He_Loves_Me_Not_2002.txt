synopsis:
Comments by Actor / Writer Roy C. Peterson This movie uses restricted editing to show first the viewpoint of a young student, Angelique, who is in love with a cardiologist, Loic. Then the narrative resets to the beginning showing the viewpoint of Loic relative to the same sequence of events. In the end the two versions converge with surprising consequences. Angelique is totally delusional about everything that happens. At the beginning we see her with a rose. We see the light of love and romance in her eyes. She thinks, and makes us believe, that Loic is her lover. Later in the Loic version we see that he just vaguely remembers handing a rose from a large bouquet he just bought for his wife to a pretty young girl (Angelique) to celebrate his wife's pregnancy. Marital effervescence to a stranger and nothing else. This a very taught, complex, and cleverly presented story about how a constitutional psychopath afflicted with DeClérambault's Syndrome will stop at absolutely nothing to actualize delusion. Also called erotomania, this is a very rare disorder and should not discourage anybody from the uninhibited expression of desire and love.
