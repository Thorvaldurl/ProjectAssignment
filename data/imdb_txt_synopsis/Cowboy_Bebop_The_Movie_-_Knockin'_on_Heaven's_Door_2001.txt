synopsis:
In the days leading up to Halloween on Mars, Faye Valentine witnesses a tanker truck explosion during a bounty chase. The blast, caused by an unidentified terrorist, releases a mysterious pathogen that spreads rapidly, killing and sickening many. In response, the Martian government announces a massive 300-million Woolong bounty for the terrorist's capture, drawing the Bebop crew into the hunt. Faye and Edward uncover the identity of the terrorist: Vincent Volaju, a soldier thought to have died on Titan. Vincent, having survived exposure to the pathogen during experimental trials, became immune but was left with amnesia and hallucinations that drove him to madness. Meanwhile, Jet investigates and discovers the pathogen is a animation-based biological weapon, illegally developed by Cherious Medical, a powerful pharmaceutical company. Spike, on the other hand, encounters Elektra Ovilo, a Cherious agent with a personal connection to Vincent. While attempting to apprehend Vincent on a train, Spike is overpowered, and Vincent unleashes another wave of the deadly animations, killing all the passengers except Elektra, who is immune due to an earlier relationship with Vincent. Elektra provides her blood sample to a trusted colleague at Cherious Medical, who begins manufacturing a vaccine. Vincent reveals his ultimate plan: to release massive jack-o'-lantern-shaped balloons filled with animations during the Mars Halloween parade, threatening to kill the entire population. To stop him, Jet enlists a group of elderly crop-duster pilots to spread the vaccine aerially, while Faye commandeers the city's weather-control system to trigger rain, ensuring the vaccine disperses widely. As the parade begins, Spike confronts Vincent in a brutal fight. Though evenly matched, Spike is cured mid-battle by the airborne vaccine as the animations are released. Just as Vincent is about to deliver a killing blow, Elektra intervenes and fatally shoots him. In his final moments, Vincent and Elektra share a bittersweet memory of their past together before he dies. With Mars saved, the Bebop crew quietly resumes their nomadic lives, each returning to the endless pursuit of bounties and their own personal journeys.
