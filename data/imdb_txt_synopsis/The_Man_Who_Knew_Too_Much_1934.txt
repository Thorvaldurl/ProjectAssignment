synopsis:
Thrilling Hitchcockian adventure
where Banks & Best run into intrigue
as their daughter is kidnapped, so
that they will not reveal information that has come into their possesion.
Sinister characters led by Lorre make sure they cannot approach the authorities. Thrilling climax for
even those of us jaded by decades
of thrillers produced since this gem was produced
