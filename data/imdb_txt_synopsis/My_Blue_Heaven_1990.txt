synopsis:
Vinny, a low-level New York mobster enters the witness protection program in a SoCal suburb. His wife abandons him and as he adjusts to his new life he not only finds old habits are hard to break, but he isn't the only one. His exploits get a lot of negative attention from the divorced local DA - Hannah. His FBI custodian, Barney - also recently divorced - works hard to keep him out of trouble. Barney and Vinny teach each other a lot about their different approaches to living. As Vinny's court date approaches, hitmen, and business ventures with some 'new' old friends bring everyone together.
